    <h1>The Most expensive Cars In The World</h1><hr>

        <h2>Ferrari F60 America ($2.5M)</h2>
        <p>The supercar is mechanically identical to the F12, but the Berlinetta isn’t exactly a Fiat Panda to begin with. Its 6.2-liter V12 churns out 740 glorious hp, enough to propel the car to 60 mph in only 3.1 seconds. The ultra-rare flag-waver hearkens back to Ferrari’s bespoke past, as the company built several region-specific sports cars in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

        <h2>Mansory Vivere Bugatti Veyron ($3.4M)</h2>
        <p>This list wouldn’t be complete without some version of the mighty Bugatti Veyron. We’re shining our spotlight on the the Mansory Vivere edition here, because not only is it one of the fastest cars in the world, it’s one of the most expensive.</p>

      <article class="car-3">
        <h2>W Motors Lykan Hypersport ($3.4M)</h2>
        <p>You may recall the Lykan Hypersport from its starring role in the blockbuster Furious 7, where the Lebanese supercar crashed through not one, not two, but three skyscrapers in Dubai. In a franchise filled with high-end exotics and one-off custom creations, the fact that the Hypersport got so much focus is a testament to its magnetism.</p>

      <article class="car-2">
        <h2>Lamborghini Veneno ($4.5M)</h2>
        <p>The car is absolutely stunning from every angle, and to this day, we’re not convinced it isn’t an alien spacecraft surveying our planet for eventual takeover. It just doesn’t seem real. The only thing more remarkable than the look is the price — a whopping $4.5 million.</p>

      <article class="car-1">
        <h2>Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita ($4.8M)</h2>
        <p>Underneath the lustrous finish lies a 4.8-liter, dual-supercharged V8 with a total output of 1,004 hp and 797 lb-ft, which means it should have little to no trouble overtaking semis on the freeway. The car’s specifications — in both performance and price — are nearly comical at this point, and just three were ever made.
Alex Todd Brand Manager at BoxyMo commented "The 1931 Bugatti Royale Kellner Coupe was sold for $8.7 million in 1987. That and many others won’t be included in this list, they are no longer available in the market."</p>
